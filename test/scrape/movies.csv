0,Cyberpunk 2077,https://s3.amazonaws.com/imgdrop.us/images/2G5QLnpN.png,Actually this is the worst game... 
1,Assassin's Creed Valhalla,https://s3.amazonaws.com/imgdrop.us/images/2G5S4g00.jpg,"Okay, so my pick for 2020 is Assassin's Creed Valhalla, out of my top three, Valhalla had the least glitches. I loved the return of the Hidden Blade and callbacks to Assassin's Creed III. The story was also more engaging than the previous entry in the series, as each member of the Order of the Ancients go their own death monologue, similar to previous titles. Hunting down the Order also feels less like a wild goose chase and more a serious hunt. I also enjoyed the continued expansion of the lore, with many more Norse/Gaelic deities revealed to be Isu. The combat also improved, feeling much more like Origins with some added brutality. Blocking and counterattacking is also much easier too. There are some issues timeline-wise, it's difficult to track when certain quests are occuring but with historical fact checking I worked out a rough basis. With this title being the newest in a long line of titles, it's obviously not recommended as an introduction to the series. At the very least - play Origins and Odyssey first."
2,Ghost of Tsushima,https://s3.amazonaws.com/imgdrop.us/images/2G5TnsO6.jpg,"Out of the ten or so 2020 games I played this year Ghost of Tsushima would be my favorite. A gripping Kurosawa-inspired samurai tale set in 13th century Japan exploring the protagonists struggle to follow tradition vs effectively adapting to deal with a mongol invasion. The game plays like a well-made Ubisoft sandbox game, typical, but highly polished. Well-trodden world structure and inane side-activities aside, the combat is a highlight with fast paced, parry-centric swordplay and varied combat styles to deal with different enemy types. Another highlight is the cast which is properly fleshed out and given plenty of development. Lastly the Kurosawa-inspired cinematography presents the world and story beautifully. Highly recommended."
3,Doom Eternal,https://s3.amazonaws.com/imgdrop.us/images/2G5V5D0e.jpg,"This year have had a few great releases, but I have only played two of those games so my pick for Game of the Year was limited. But my choice went to DOOM Eternal. I loved the 2016 version of DOOM, I played it until completion, got everything maxed out and ran through the levels several times. When DOOM Eternal released I was ecstatic, I spent the next days only playing this game. And you guessed it, to completion. Right of the bat I have to say it is not better than the 2016 version. The game brings a few new enemies that will challenge you on your journey through the game and adapt the strategy used whenever a battle starts. The game introduces platforming and it's something that was recieved with mixed opinions amongst the playerbase. I personally think it works and is not overused as many others lead you to believe. The story itself needs no mention, you kill demons and try to save earth. I will mention however that in this game there's a hub (in space, Justice League style), between levels where you can train, look at collectibles and select missions.  I will very much recommend people to play this game, but do play DOOM from 2016 before doing so."
4,Hades,https://s3.amazonaws.com/imgdrop.us/images/2G5WvbsL.jpg,"My Favorite Game of the Year goes to Hades, a rogue-like with a Greek mythology-based setting. Developed by Supergiant Games, which made a name for itself over the last decade with highly acclaimed titles: Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre. Hades feels like the culmination of what Supergiant has learned over the years, combining and improving the best aspects of their previous titles. It’s a game that does so many things so well - An epic soundtrack, thoughtful storytelling, beautiful art, charismatic characters, and a very engaging combat system. I like how there are a variety of weapons, each with different forms that change the way you can play, and the huge amount of abilities and modifiers that are gifted by the gods of Olympus. Despite the nature of the game, it does not feel repetitive even if you play over and over before returning to the underworld once you’ve been killed by one of Hades' powerful foes. That repetition builds the story itself. I highly recommend it, especially if you are new to rogue-likes."
5,Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,https://4thegamers172212971.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/jedi-fallen-order.jpg?w=940&h=528&crop=1,"An open-world action-adventure Star Wars game is something I’ve looked forward to since The Force Unleashed. Let me say, Jedi: Fallen Order does not disappoint. It has an engaging story with memorable characters and quality game play. There's some major call backs to the prequel movies and even The Clone Wars TV series which was really cool for them to have included. The Inquisitor villains are especially neat, and they’re not even originally made for the game. Second Sister and Ninth Sister were made for the Vader comic series and included in the game. The game also includes customizations, ranging from lightsabers to clothing and ship designs. I recommend this to anyone who is a big Star Wars fan, or as an introduction into Star Wars."
6,Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446587857457643541/658758387097534530/sekiro.jpg,"Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the latest game in From Software's Soulsborne franchise (Soulsbornetwice now?), a franchise so good that it spawned a new genre which I'm particularly fond of. The game puts heavier emphasis on stealth, vertical traversal and parrying than its contemporaries, and the parry-centric combat in particular makes this the most skill-based game among them all. A delight to play with great bosses and excellent combat variety. The world-building is good as ever with a rich lore to explore, though as usual the overt plot and the characters that are more NPC than character detracts somewhat. The Sengoku period of Japan with mythological elements is presented beautifully here with picturesque vistas and vivid color schemes. Recommended to any fan of soulslike action games."
7,Kingdom Hearts III,https://www.actugaming.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kingdom-hearts-iii-infos-dlc-remind.jpg,"Picking this years game was hard due to me not having played many games this year. But then Kingdom Hearts III came to mind. I waited 13 years for this game and waited eagerly the last weeks until release. Revisiting and continuing the story of Kingdom Hearts brought back the memories of the first games and also the confusion it brought. With the story I also got to meet Sora, Donald & Goofy again. They have always been an amazing and fun trio of heroes throughout the series and they kept that chemistry in the third game. But Kingdom Hearts has one unique part which brought me in 17 years ago with the first game, and that is the worlds of Disney. I might be a gamer for the most part but Disney is an equal big part of me and being able to run around in Andy’s room while talking to Woody & Buzz, run around with Rapunzel in Tangled or finally explore parts of Hercules world made this game so much more enjoyable than I ever thought it could. Because I enjoyed my time playing I can look past all the shortcomings of the game simply because it didn’t bother me while I was playing, I was having fun. Lastly this is a game I would recommend to anyone who likes Disney."
8,Blasphemous,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N1wHiHstc9E/maxresdefault.jpg,"The Game Kitchen, previously known only from a small, independent and minimalist series of point and click games - The Last Door, went on to something more ambitious – Blasphemous. That's why I was quite skeptical about how the studio would handle a souls-like game. But I wasn’t disappointed. The game draws a lot from the Dark Souls series and from its 2D equivalent - Salt and Sanctuary, while it hasn’t lost its original character. The game is difficult, but pleasantly difficult, not annoying, which is sometimes difficult to do at an optimal level. The stages are very complex, interesting and diverse. The fighting system is amazing and satisfying. Additionally, quite an interesting character development was used, completely different compared to other souls-like games, resembling metroidvania games. The audio-visual setting is brilliant as well. The atmosphere is clearly inspired by the dark side of Christianity. To sum everything up, this is my favorite game of 2019 and I would recommend it to anyone who, like me, is a fan of souls-like games."
9,Three Houses,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/522124674633564160/659945520638328850/redimensionar2.png,"As a Fire Emblem fan since the days of the GBA titles, I have been looking forward to the release of Three Houses ever since it was announced. While the setting bothered me a bit first, all my doubts were swept away when I finally played the game. Three House managed to suck me in with its great story, interesting characters and fantastic soundtrack, which made me fall in love with this game. The gameplay is some of the best any Fire Emblem can offer, it's enjoyable for both veterans and newcomers. Anyone with a Switch and a love for strategic RPGs should put Three Houses on their wishlist."
